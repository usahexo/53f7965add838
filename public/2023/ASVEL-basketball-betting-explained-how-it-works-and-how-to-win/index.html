ASVEL is a French professional basketball club that competes in the LNB Pro A, the top-tier level of French basketball. In this article, we will explain how to bet on ASVEL and give some tips on how to win.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is get acquainted with the different types of bets that are available. The most common bets are moneyline bets, where you simply bet on who will win the game, and point spread bets, where you bet on how many points a team will win or lose by. There are also more complex bets like total points over&#x2F;under and halftime&#x2F;fulltime results.</p>
<p>Once you know what type of bet you want to place, you need to find a reputable online sportsbook that offers good odds and competitive lines. We recommend <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.bethard.com/">https://www.bethard.com/</a>, which is our top-rated sportsbook for French basketball betting. They offer great odds on all ASVEL games and have a wide range of betting options available.</p>
<p>Now that you have your betting account set up, it’s time to start making some profits! Here are some tips for betting on ASVEL:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look for games where ASVEL is playing against an inferior opponent. The odds will be heavily skewed in favour of ASVEL in these matches, so it’s a good opportunity to make some easy profits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try betting on the over&#x2F;under total points market. This market is often very tight, so finding the right line can lead to big profits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Ladbrokes’ free bet promotion when betting on ASVEL games. Ladbrokes offers new customers a free bet worth up to €50 when they open an account and place their first bet. This can be used to great effect when betting on close games where the result could go either way.</p>
</li>

<h1 id="ASVEL’s-sports-betting-scandal-rocks-French-basketball"><a href="#ASVEL’s-sports-betting-scandal-rocks-French-basketball" class="headerlink" title="ASVEL’s sports betting scandal rocks French basketball"></a>ASVEL’s sports betting scandal rocks French basketball</h1><p>On Tuesday, the French basketball league (LNB) announced that it had opened an investigation into possible match-fixing by ASVEL, a team based in Lyon. The news rocked the French basketball world, as ASVEL is a perennial contender and the three-time defending champion.</p>
<p>According to LNB president Jean-Pierre Siemen, the league’s inspectors were tipped off about possible irregularities in two games from last season. In one game, ASVEL was heavily favored but lost to Orléans; in the other, they almost blew a huge lead but pulled out a victory over Bourg-en-Bresse.</p>
<p>Siemen refused to elaborate on the details of the investigation, but did say that it would be wide-ranging and that no one was above suspicion. “It’s not just Lyon,” he said. “We’re looking at all of our teams.”</p>
<p>The news sent shockwaves through the French basketball community. ASVEL is considered one of the country’s top teams, and their success has been a source of pride for fans across France. This is not the first time that they have been involved in a match-fixing scandal; in 2007, seven players from the team were banned from playing for five years after being caught betting on matches.</p>
<p> ASVEL released a statement denying any wrongdoing and expressing their willingness to cooperate with the LNB’s investigation. However, fans are not convinced. Some are calling for head coach Lionel Hollins to step down, while others are demanding that the team be stripped of its championship titles.</p>
<p>Whatever ends up happening, this scandal is sure to have a major impact on French basketball. Stay tuned for updates as the story unfolds.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-bet-on-ASVEL-games-Tips-and-strategies-from-an-expert"><a href="#How-to-bet-on-ASVEL-games-Tips-and-strategies-from-an-expert" class="headerlink" title="How to bet on ASVEL games: Tips and strategies from an expert"></a>How to bet on ASVEL games: Tips and strategies from an expert</h1><p>Basketball is a sport that is loved by many. In the United States, it is one of the most popular sports. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the top professional league in America. However, there are other leagues around the world that people can bet on as well. One such league is the Ligue Nationale de Basket-ball (LNB), which is the top professional basketball league in France.</p>
<p>The ASVEL Basket club is a team that plays in this league. They are based in Villeurbanne, which is a suburb of Lyon. The team was founded in 2001 and has enjoyed much success over the years. Some notable players who have played for ASVEL include Boris Diaw, Tony Parker, and Josh Howard.</p>
<p>If you are interested in betting on games involving ASVEL, there are a few things that you need to know. In this article, I will provide some tips and strategies for betting on ASVEL games.</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at the odds</li>
</ol>
<p>When looking to bet on a particular team, it is important to look at the odds first. This will give you an idea of how likely it is that the team will win. The higher the odds, the less likely it is that the team will win.</p>
<p>ASVEL typically has pretty good odds when playing against teams from smaller leagues. However, their odds tend to be lower when playing against teams from bigger leagues. For example, their odds might be 2:1 when playing against a team from a smaller league, but their odds might be 7:2 when playing against a team from a bigger league.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Know the strengths and weaknesses of each team</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to know the strengths and weaknesses of each team before placing a bet. This will help you make informed decisions about which bets to place. ASVEL typically does well against teams that play slow-paced styles of basketball, but they struggle against teams that play up-tempo basketball styles.</p>
<pre><code>  3) Look at recent results
</code></pre>
<p>It is also important to look at recent results before placing any bets. This will give you an idea of how each team has been performing recently. ASVEL has had some good results lately, winning six of their last ten games overall. However, they have also had some bad results recently, losing four of their last ten games overall. 4) Use betting websites There are many different websites where you can bet on basketball games online . These websites offer a variety of different betting options including point spreads , totals , moneylines , and head-to-head matchups . When choosing a website to use for your bets, it is important to make sure that you trust them . There have been several cases where people have lost money because they used fraudulent websites . 5) Placing bets: Point spreads One type of bet that you can place on basketball games is called a point spread . A point spread bet involves guessing whether or not a particular team will win by more than a certain number of points . For example , if ASVEL were playing against Panathinaikos and the point spread was set at 7 points , then someone who placed a wager on ASVEL would win if they won by more than 7 points . If they lost by 6 points or less , then the person who placed the wager on Panathinaikos would win . 6) Placing bets: Totals Another type of bet that you can place on basketball games is called totals . A total bet involves guessing how many points will be scored in total during the course of the game . For example , if ASVEL were playing against Panathinaikos and the total was set at 144 points , then someone who placed a wager on OVER 144 would win if both teams scored more than 144 points combined . If either team only scored 143 points or fewer , then the person who placed the wager on UNDER 144 would win instead</p>
<h1 id="ASVEL-moves-into-sports-betting-with-new-partnership"><a href="#ASVEL-moves-into-sports-betting-with-new-partnership" class="headerlink" title="ASVEL moves into sports betting with new partnership"></a>ASVEL moves into sports betting with new partnership</h1><p>The ASVEL basketball club, based in Lyon, France, has announced a partnership with the Swiss online sports betting company Sportradar AG. The partnership will see Sportradar become the official betting partner of the club, and will include data and image rights for ASVEL.</p>
<p>Sportradar is a leading provider of sport-related data services and content, including live data feeds, statistics, news and video footage. The company works with more than 400 gaming operators and broadcasters in over 80 countries around the world.</p>
<p>For ASVEL, this new partnership represents an important move into the world of sports betting. The club already has a strong following among fans in France, and this new agreement with Sportradar will give it access to a wealth of global betting data and content. This should help to attract even more fans to ASVEL’s games, as well as to promote the club’s brand around the world.</p>
<p>Sportradar has been active in the basketball market for some time now. In addition to its work with ASVEL, the company is also a long-term partner of Euroleague Basketball, one of Europe’s most prestigious basketball leagues.</p>
<p>This latest agreement is another sign that Sportradar is becoming a leading player in the global sports betting market. With its strong track record in providing quality data and content, as well as its partnerships with some of the biggest names in sport, Sportradar is well positioned to take advantage of the growing interest in sports betting around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-tips-for-upcoming-ASVEL-matchups"><a href="#Sports-betting-tips-for-upcoming-ASVEL-matchups" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting tips for upcoming ASVEL matchups"></a>Sports betting tips for upcoming ASVEL matchups</h1><p>The top basketball league in France, Ligue 1, is heating up as the playoffs near. One of the teams in the running for the title is ASVEL. Let’s take a look at their upcoming matchups and see what sports betting tips we can glean from them.</p>
<p>The first matchup is against Strasbourg on April 3. Strasbourg is currently in 7th place in the league, so they should be an easy opponent for ASVEL. The current odds for this matchup are ASVEL -8500, meaning that you would need to bet $8,500 to win $100 if ASVEL wins. However, I think there is value betting on Strasbourg +2700 given their recent form and home court advantage.</p>
<p>ASVEL’s next matchup is against Olympique Lyonnais on April 6. Lyon is currently in 2nd place in the league, so this will be a tougher matchup for ASVEL. The current odds for this matchup are Lyon -2200, meaning that you would need to bet $2200 to win $100 if Lyon wins. I think there is value betting on Lyon -1600 or higher as they are a much better team than Strasbourg.</p>
<p>ASVEL’s final matchup of the season is against Monaco on April 9. Monaco is currently in 1st place in the league and is expected to win easily against ASVEL. The current odds for this matchup are Monaco -45000, meaning that you would need to bet $45,000 to win $100 if Monaco wins. I don’t see any value betting on either side in this matchup.</p>
