        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="In-Poker-Precisely-What-Beats-What-Arizona-Cardinals"><a href="#In-Poker-Precisely-What-Beats-What-Arizona-Cardinals" class="headerlink" title="In Poker, Precisely What Beats What: Arizona Cardinals"></a>In Poker, Precisely What Beats What: Arizona Cardinals</h1><p>The NFL offseason is heating up and Arizona Cardinals fans are wondering what moves the team will make to get them back in the playoffs. Let’s take a look at the matchups between the different positions on the Cardinals and see who would come out on top.</p>
<p>QB vs. LB: The Cardinals’ LBs would have a tough time against QB Carson Palmer. He is crafty and has a strong arm. He can easily beat linebackers with his quick release and passes.</p>
<p>RB vs. DB: The Cardinals’ RBs would have an easy time against the DBs. David Johnson is a hard runner who can break tackles and Chris Johnson is still quick enough to outrun most defenders. Additionally, the Cardinals have good depth at RB with Andre Ellington and Stepfan Taylor.</p>
<p>WR vs. CB: The WRs would have an advantage over the CBs, but it wouldn’t be by much. Patrick Peterson is one of the best cornerbacks in the league and should be able to hold his own against Larry Fitzgerald, Michael Floyd, or John Brown. However, if Peterson is injured or slowed down by another player, then the Cardinals would be in trouble.</p>
<h1 id="Cardinals-Take-Down-49ers-in-Poker-Showdown"><a href="#Cardinals-Take-Down-49ers-in-Poker-Showdown" class="headerlink" title="Cardinals Take Down 49ers in Poker Showdown"></a>Cardinals Take Down 49ers in Poker Showdown</h1><p>In what has become an annual battle, the Cardinals and 49ers faced off in a poker showdown this past weekend. The Cards were led by MVP quarterback Carson Palmer, while the Niners were quarterbacked by Colin Kaepernick. The game was close throughout, with the Cardinals leading most of the way, but the 49ers made a late comeback to take a lead with just minutes remaining.</p>
<p>It looked like San Francisco might pull out the win, but then Palmer led the Cardinals on a stunning comeback, scoring the winning touchdown with just seconds left on the clock. The victory gave Arizona its sixth win of the season, keeping them in contention for a playoff spot.</p>
<p>“We never give up, no matter how down we are,” said Palmer after the game. “We just kept fighting and managed to pull out a victory in the end.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals are now 7-5 and in second place in their division, behind only Seattle. They will need to win their final three games to have any chance at making the playoffs, but it’s definitely not an impossible task.</p>
<h1 id="Eagles-Fall-to-Cardinals-in-David-vs-Goliath-Poker-Battle"><a href="#Eagles-Fall-to-Cardinals-in-David-vs-Goliath-Poker-Battle" class="headerlink" title="Eagles Fall to Cardinals in David vs Goliath Poker Battle"></a>Eagles Fall to Cardinals in David vs Goliath Poker Battle</h1><p>The Philadelphia Eagles were the decided underdogs against the Arizona Cardinals in last night’s Monday Night Football matchup. The Cardinals, who were starting their third-string quarterback, Ryan Lindley, were 5.5 point favorites going into the game.</p>
<p>Both offenses struggled in the early going, with neither team managing to score in the first quarter. The Cardinals finally got on the board early in the second quarter, with a touchdown pass from Lindley to John Brown. The Eagles responded later in the quarter with a touchdown run by DeMarco Murray, tying the game at 7 apiece going into halftime.</p>
<p>The third quarter was a defensive battle, with both teams failing to score. However, late in the quarter, Arizona retook the lead with a field goal. The Eagles came close to tying up the game again midway through the fourth quarter, but missed a 51-yard field goal attempt.</p>
<p>With just over two minutes left in the game and down 10-7,the Eagles were facing 4th and 5 on their own 43-yard line. Coach Chip Kelly decided to go for it, and quarterback Mark Sanchez completed a pass to wide receiver Jeremy Maclin for a first down. However, Arizona’s defense held strong from there and sealed the victory for the Cardinals.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing loss for Philly fans, who had high hopes for their team this season. Despite being underdogs, it was not an impossible task for them to pull off an upset win over Arizona. With games against some of the league’s weaker teams coming up on their schedule, there is still plenty of time for them to make a run for the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="In-Close-Game-Cardinals-Defeat-Raiders-with-Winning-Hand-in-Poker"><a href="#In-Close-Game-Cardinals-Defeat-Raiders-with-Winning-Hand-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="In Close Game, Cardinals Defeat Raiders with Winning Hand in Poker"></a>In Close Game, Cardinals Defeat Raiders with Winning Hand in Poker</h1><p>The Arizona Cardinals were able to hold on in the final minutes to pull off a victory against the Oakland Raiders in a closely contested poker game. The Cardinals had been down most of the game but were able to make a big comeback in the last few hands, winning with a flush.</p>
<p>“It was definitely a hard-fought game,” said Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer. “The Raiders put up a good fight, but we managed to come out on top.”</p>
<p>The Raiders had been leading for most of the game, thanks in part to a strong performance from quarterback Derek Carr. But late in the fourth quarter, the Cardinals mounted an impressive comeback, scoring 10 points in just three hands to take the lead.</p>
<p>“We just kept our heads down and kept playing our cards right,” said Cardinals running back David Johnson. “And eventually we were able to pull off the win.”</p>
<p>The Cardinals will now move on to face the Dallas Cowboys in the next round of the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Jaguars-Lose-to-Cardinals-in-Triple-Overtime-Thriller"><a href="#Jaguars-Lose-to-Cardinals-in-Triple-Overtime-Thriller" class="headerlink" title="Jaguars Lose to Cardinals in Triple Overtime Thriller"></a>Jaguars Lose to Cardinals in Triple Overtime Thriller</h1><p>In a game that will long be remembered, the Jacksonville Jaguars (2-1) lost to the Arizona Cardinals (1-2) in triple overtime, 27-24.</p>
<p>It was back and forth all day, as both teams exchanged touchdowns in the first half. The Jaguars led 21-14 at halftime, but the Cardinals came back to take a 24-21 lead in the fourth quarter. Jacksonville regained the lead with a touchdown pass from Blake Bortles to Donte Moncrief with less than two minutes remaining, but Carson Palmer led an impressive drive in the final minute to tie it up and send it to overtime.</p>
<p>The first overtime period was scoreless, but Chandler Catanzaro kicked a field goal in the second one to give Arizona the lead. Jacksonville had a chance to win it at the end of regulation, but Bortles’ pass was intercepted in the end zone.</p>
<p>In the third overtime, Jaguars kicker Jason Myers missed a field goal attempt, and Arizona’s David Johnson scored on a run to clinch the victory.</p>
<p>It was an emotional loss for Jacksonville, which played most of the game without their star running back Leonard Fournette. They will have to put it behind them quickly as they prepare for a tough matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs (3-0) next week.</p>
