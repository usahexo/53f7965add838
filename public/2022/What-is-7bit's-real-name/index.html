      		<h1 id="What-is-7bit’s-real-name"><a href="#What-is-7bit’s-real-name" class="headerlink" title="What is 7bit’s real name?"></a>What is 7bit’s real name?</h1><p>According to his public Bitcointalk profile, 7bit’s real name is “Sergey”. However, this has not been confirmed by any other sources.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-he-from"><a href="#Where-is-he-from" class="headerlink" title="Where is he from?"></a>Where is he from?</h1><p>A little birdy told me that Drake is from Canada. Specifically, he is from Toronto, Ontario.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-he-get-his-start"><a href="#How-did-he-get-his-start" class="headerlink" title="How did he get his start?"></a>How did he get his start?</h1><p>Drake started out as an actor on the popular Canadian teen drama series Degrassi: The Next Generation. He played Jimmy Brooks, a character who was wheelchair-bound after being shot. After his stint on the show, Drake began to focus on his music career.</p>
<h1 id="What-type-of-music-does-he-make"><a href="#What-type-of-music-does-he-make" class="headerlink" title="What type of music does he make?"></a>What type of music does he make?</h1><p>Drake is a rapper, but he doesn’t fit into the typical rap category. His music is more alternative and R&amp;B-based. He has been called the “new face of hip-hop” because of his unique style.</p>
<h1 id="How-successful-has-he-been"><a href="#How-successful-has-he-been" class="headerlink" title="How successful has he been?"></a>How successful has he been?</h1><p>Drake has had massive success since starting his music career in 2006. He has released five studio albums, all of which have reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart. He has also won several awards, including five GRAMMY Awards and six American Music Awards.</p>
<h1 id="Why-did-he-start-making-music"><a href="#Why-did-he-start-making-music" class="headerlink" title="Why did he start making music?"></a>Why did he start making music?</h1><p>It all started when he was just a little kid. He loved music and he loved making things. So he started making music.</p>
<p>Making music is a great way to express yourself. It’s a way to share your feelings with the world. And that’s why he started making music. He wanted to share his feelings with the world.</p>
<p>And he’s been making music ever since. He’s released dozens of albums, and his music has been featured on TV and in movies.</p>
<p>People have told him that his music has changed their lives. And that’s why he keeps doing it. He knows that his music can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>
<p>He loves making music, and he loves knowing that his music is touching people’s lives. It’s the best feeling in the world.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-his-favorite-thing-to-do-outside-of-music"><a href="#What-is-his-favorite-thing-to-do-outside-of-music" class="headerlink" title="What is his favorite thing to do outside of music?"></a>What is his favorite thing to do outside of music?</h1><p>In a previous interview, Ed Sheeran said his favorite thing to do outside of music is play video games. “I love video games,” he said. “I’m really into my video games. I’m quite a geeky guy.”</p>
<p>Sheeran isn’t the only celebrity who loves gaming. In fact, there are quite a few celebrities who love gaming so much they’ve even created their own video games. For example, rapper and actor Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, has his own mobile game called G-Unit Radio which allows users to battle other players online.</p>
<p>And then there’s Justin Bieber, who teamed up with Rovio Entertainment, the creators of Angry Birds, to release an AR mini-game for the worldwide smash hit game Angry Birds 2. In the game, players help Justin Bieber collect coins and dodge obstacles as they try to make their way to the concert stage.</p>
<p>So why do celebrities love gaming so much? One reason could be that it’s a great way for them to escape from reality and just have some fun. Gaming can also help celebrities blow off some steam after a long day of work. And let’s not forget that many celebrities are actually pretty good at gaming too. So it’s no surprise that they enjoy playing them every now and then.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-his-goal-with-music"><a href="#What-is-his-goal-with-music" class="headerlink" title="What is his goal with music?"></a>What is his goal with music?</h1><p>What is his goal with music? Is it to make money, or is it to reach people and touch them in some way? Many people in the industry view music as a business, and they are in it for the money. However, there are also artists out there who see music as a way to connect with people on a deeper level. They want to share their message and touch people’s hearts with their music.</p>
<p>For most artists, money is not the main goal. They just want to be able to share their music with the world. This is what drives them to continue making music, even when things get tough. There is a passion there that cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Of course, many artists do want to make money from their music, and that is perfectly understandable. However, at the end of the day, if they can reach people and touch them with their music, then they have succeeded in what they set out to do.</p>
