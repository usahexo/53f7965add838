To this day, they remain some of the most widely read and beloved poetry in the English language. The author’s name? William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>While we may think of Shakespeare as a playwright, many of his works were originally written in sonnet form. And like any good poet, Shakespeare was fascinated with the concept of change. In particular, he was intrigued by how life can be full of endless flux - a theme that is explored in many of his plays, including Macbeth and King Lear.</p>
<p>This week, we’re going to take a look at one of Shakespeare’s most famous sonnets, number 18: “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?”. In this sonnet, Shakespeare compares the beauty of his love to the beauty of a summer day. He talks about how both are full of potential for growth and change, and how both are fleeting and temporary.</p>
<p>What is interesting about this sonnet is that it wasn’t actually published until 1609 - several years after it was written. This suggests that Shakespeare may have been performing it privately for friends and family members before finally putting it into print.</p>
<p>As we mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare’s death this year, let’s take a look at some of his most famous sonnets. Sonnet 18 is just one example - but each one is worth reading in its own right.</p>

<h1 id="Get-Your-Slot-on-With-the-Bard"><a href="#Get-Your-Slot-on-With-the-Bard" class="headerlink" title="Get Your Slot on With the Bard!"></a>Get Your Slot on With the Bard!</h1><p>The slot machine industry is booming and everyone wants a piece of the action. Whether you’re a slots enthusiast or just looking to try your luck, we’ve got the information you need to get started. In this article, we’ll discuss what slot machines are, how they work and give you some tips on how to play. So put on your lucky pants and let’s get started!</p>
<p>Slot machines, also known as one-armed bandits, are a casino staple. They come in all shapes and sizes, from the classic 3-reel machine to the more complex video slots. Slot machines work by taking your bet and dividing it by the number of lines played. This gives you your payout multiplier. For example, if you bet $1 per line on a machine with 20 lines and hit the jackpot, you would win $20 000 (20x your bet).</p>
<p>There are many different strategies for playing slots, but here are a few tips to help you get started:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Decide how much money you’re willing to lose before you start playing – this will help limit any potential losses.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Always read the paytable before playing – it will tell you how much each symbol is worth and help you choose which games to play.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try out different games until you find one that suits your style – not all slot machines are created equal! Some have bonus rounds that can really boost your winnings, while others have more lucrative jackpots.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you keep track of how many spins you’ve made – this will help prevent you from spending too much money in a short period of time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t forget to use your bonus coins! Many online casinos offer free bonus coins that can be used on any slot game of your choice.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So there you have it – everything you need to know about playing slots! Just remember to have fun and be responsible with your bets – after all, it’s all about enjoying yourself while trying for that life-changing jackpot!</p>
