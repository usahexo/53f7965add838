No surrender in blackjack means you cannot fold even if you are dealt a lousy hand. Some experts think this is the only way to play the game, while others believe it is a risky proposition. Let’s take a closer look at both sides of the issue.

Those in favor of no surrender say that folding too often will cause you to lose money in the long run. If you are dealt a bad hand, you might as well stick it out and see if you can improve your position. Even if you lose, you haven’t lost anything by folding early – you would have lost just as much by standing pat with a lousy hand.

On the other hand, those who oppose no surrender say that it is simply too risky to stay in the game when the odds are against you. It’s always better to cut your losses and move on to the next hand. In fact, some experts claim that no surrender doubles your chances of losing money in the long run.

So which is better – no surrender or folding? The answer depends on your playing style and how comfortable you feel about taking risks. If you are willing to risk losing more money in order to increase your chances of winning, then no surrender may be right for you. However, if you prefer to play it safe, then folding may be the better option.

You've probably seen the movie 21, or heard of the MIT blackjack team. They were a group of students who used mathematical strategies to beat casinos at blackjack. The thing is, even if you're not a card counting genius, you can still win at blackjack by using some simple techniques.

In this article, we'll go over the basics of blackjack strategy, and teach you how to play like a pro. So put on your sunglasses and designer suit, it's time to hit the casino!

The Goal of Blackjack

The goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player bets against the dealer, and the player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand. If both hands are equal, it's called a "push," and no one wins or loses money.

There are a few different ways to play blackjack - we'll cover them later in this article - but they all follow the same basic rules:

- You can either hit (take another card) or stand (end your turn).

- If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically.

- The dealer must stand on 17 and draw on 16.




















  Basic Blackjack Strategy 

   Playing blackjack is all about making smart choices - especially when it comes to choosing whether to hit or stand. In order to reduce the house edge (the advantage casinos have over players), you should follow basic blackjack strategy. This means that you should make certain decisions based on the cards you are dealt, rather than playing hunches or guessing what might be best.  Here are some tips for basic blackjack strategy:   Hitting When your first two cards add up to 12 or less, always hit . Even if the dealer is showing an ace, it's generally better to take another card in hopes of getting closer to 21.
 waro ne’s pā’ia e manaʻo i ka holoholo ana ma loko o ka papa hou me kekahi mau haumāna ma ka ‘ōlelo Hawai`i? You don't want to bust , so if your first two cards total more than 12, stand pat .  Suppose you have an eight and a six - should you hit when the dealer has an ace up? According to basic strategy , you should continue hitting until your total reaches 17 or higher. This gives you the best chance of winning without going bust .  Stands When doubling down , always do so on 11 . This increases your chances of winning by giving yourself an extra card - assuming the dealer doesn't also have 11 .  Suppose you have a nine and two Queens face up. Normally, you would want to hit in this situation - but with double down available, it's smarter to stand . This way, if the dealer has any natural (two-card) value of 18 or more , she will bust - which means you automatically win!  Avoid Splitting Pairs If both cards in a pair are low (6s or below), then don't split them . Just hit instead (unless doubling down is allowed). A pair of nines , eights , fives etc. can be split , however . So can pairs of Aces .  Suppose you are dealt two eights . It would usually be wise to split them , because each eight becomes two new hands that can potentially win independently . But if the dealer has an Ace up , it's better not split in case he gets BlackJack (a two-card hand totalling 21 ). Remember: never split 4s , 5s or 10s !

 Doubling Down Another important decision that comes into play during blackjack is doubling down . This occurs when a player takes an additional bet equal in size to their original bet - with the understanding that they will only receive one more card from the deck from which they originally drew their hand. Doubling down allows players to increase their chances of winning provided they choose wisely - as well as increase their potential payout should they happen to win! There are several instances where doubling down makes sense:  When your first two cards add up 10 points or 11 points (provided the dealer doesn't have 10 points or 11 points). When your first two cards are an Ace and any number between 2 and 9 points inclusive (-Ace counts as 1 point). When offered insurance ; see “Insurance" below for details). These three scenarios encompass most cases where doubling down makes sense; there are others but these tend be situational specificities which inexperienced players may wish not worry about just yet!
