#  What is the company behind 7bit slots? 

7Bit slots is a Malta-based online casino that offers a wide range of games, including slots, roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. The company is licensed and regulated by the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA), which is one of the most respected regulators in the world. 7Bit slots is also eCogra certified, which guarantees that the games are fair and honest.

The company was founded in 2014 by a group of experienced entrepreneurs who wanted to create an online casino that would offer players the best possible gaming experience. 7Bit slots is committed to providing its customers with a safe and fun environment where they can enjoy some of the best games in the industry.

# What types of games does 7bit slots offer? 

7Bit slots offers a wide range of games, including slots, roulette, blackjack, and baccarat. There are also a number of jackpot games available, including Mega Moolah and Hall of Gods. In addition to these popular games, 7Bit slots also offers a number of unique titles that can only be found at this casino.

# What makes 7bit slots different from other casinos? 

7Bit slots is one of the few casinos that offers a live casino experience. This allows players to interact with real dealers and players from around the world. Additionally, 7Bit slots is one of the few casinos that offer a native Bitcoin casino experience. Players can use Bitcoin to deposit and withdraw funds from their account, and they can also use Bitcoin to play select games.

#  What was the motivation behind creating the game? 

The developers of the game, 4A Games, were motivated to create the game as a way to show their appreciation for the works of George Orwell. In an interview with Rock, Paper, Shotgun, senior producer Oleg Yavorsky stated that "We're all huge fans of Orwell's books here at 4A Games. We'd been discussing the possibility of making a game based on one of his novels for some time, but it was only after we read 1984 that we knew we had to make it."

# What are some of the themes in the game?

The game is set in a dystopian world where citizens are kept under constant surveillance by the government. The themes of censorship, propaganda, and Big Brother are prevalent in the game.

#  How does it differ from other slot games available? 

The popularity of slot games is no secret. They are easy to play and can offer massive payouts. With this in mind, it is not surprising that so many different versions of the game exist. However, there are some key differences between slot games that players should be aware of before they start playing.

The first thing to note is that there are two main types of slot games: classic slots and video slots. Classic slots usually have three reels and one payline, while video slots have five reels and multiple paylines. This means that video slots offer more ways to win, which can lead to bigger payouts.

Another difference between slot games is the betting options available. Some games allow players to choose how many lines they want to bet on, while others require players to bet on all lines. This can affect the size of the wagers players need to make in order to qualify for the jackpot.

Finally, slot games have different bonus features that can add an extra element of excitement to the game. These can include free spins, bonus rounds and multipliers. Players should research which games offer the best bonuses before deciding which ones to play.

#  What has been the game's reception since its release? 

Since its release in March of 2017, "Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild" has been met with critical acclaim. The game currently holds a 97% on review aggregate site Metacritic, making it the highest rated game of all time on the site. 

Many critics praise the game for its open-world design and its freedom to explore. Several outlets have given the game a perfect score, including IGN, Game Informer, Polygon, and Destructoid. 

The game was not without its detractors, however. Some gamers felt that the game was too easy and could be completed in a relatively short amount of time. Others found fault with the game's graphics, which were seen as a downgrade from those featured in "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword". 

Despite these criticisms, "Breath of the Wild" was able to achieve commercial success as well. The game sold over 4 million copies in its first month alone, becoming the fastest-selling video game in Nintendo's history.

#  Are there any future plans for the game that can be shared yet?

There are always future plans for the game in development, but we can’t share any details yet. We are constantly working on developing new content and features to keep the game fresh and exciting for our players.

# What has been the team’s favorite addition or change to the game so far?

There have been many great additions and changes to the game so far, but if we had to pick one, it would be the dungeon system. The dungeon system offers a lot of new gameplay possibilities and challenges that players can explore. It’s been a lot of fun for us to watch players explore the different dungeons and try out different strategies.
