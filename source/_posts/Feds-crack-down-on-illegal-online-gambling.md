#  Feds crack down on illegal online gambling

The Justice Department announced a crackdown on illegal online gambling on April 15, 2019. This follows an earlier crackdown in 2011.

Officials say that the new crackdown is aimed at websites that operate illegally in the United States. These websites accept bets and payments from U.S. citizens, which is illegal under federal law.

One of the main goals of the crackdown is to shut down these websites and keep U.S. citizens from gambling online. Officials also hope to block payments to these websites and seize their assets.

The Justice Department stressed that this is not a new campaign against gambling, but rather a continuation of efforts to enforce federal law. They added that this campaign is not directed at legal online gambling businesses, which are licensed and regulated by individual states.

So far, the Justice Department has seized over $25 million in assets from illegal online gambling websites.

#  Senator calls for crackdown on online slot machines

A U.S. senator is calling for a crackdown on online slot machines, saying they are being used by gambling addicts and children.

In a speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley said addiction to the games has become a public health crisis. He called for action to protect vulnerable people from what he called "a legal form of casino."

Grassley said casino companies have created slot machines that can be played on smartphones and other electronic devices, making them easy for children to access. He said the games are designed to produce a sense of euphoria that can be addictive.

Iowa is one of several states that have legalized online slot machines.

#  Slot machine addiction leads to bankruptcy

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games, enjoyed by both casual and experienced gamblers. While they can be fun and exciting to play, they can also be addictive and lead to financial ruin.

One study found that almost half of all problem gamblers had incurred significant financial losses as a result of their addiction to slot machines. In fact, many people become so obsessed with playing slots that they end up going bankrupt.

There are a number of reasons why slot machines can be so addictive. Firstly, they are very easy to play, and can be very lucrative if you hit the right combination. Secondly, they give players a sense of excitement and anticipation that other games don't provide. This can be particularly dangerous for people who are susceptible to addiction.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a slot machine addiction, it is important to seek help as soon as possible. There are a number of support groups available that can help you get your life back on track.

#  Fla. lawmaker wants to ban slot machine gambling online

A Florida lawmaker wants to ban slot machine gambling online, arguing that it's too easy for children and addicts to access the games.

Republican Rep. Jay Fant is filing a bill that would prohibit internet gambling companies from accepting bets from Florida residents. The measure would also make it a crime to operate or promote an internet gaming site within the state.

"As technology advances, we must be proactive in protecting our citizens," Fant said in a statement. "This legislation will ensure that minors and addicts do not have easy access to gambling services and help keep Florida families safe."

Slot machine gambling is currently legal in Florida, with casinos and racetracks offering the games. But online gambling is not allowed, and Fant says it's time to close that loophole.

The bill has yet to be filed, so it's not clear how much support it will have in the Legislature. But lawmakers have been increasingly wary of internet gambling, with several states considering bans or restrictions on the activity.

#  N.J. Assemblyman seeks ban on slot machines in New Jersey

Slot machines are a scourge on society, contributing to gambling addiction and other social problems. They should be banned in New Jersey.

Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll introduced legislation on Monday that would prohibit the operation of slot machines in the state.

“Slot machines are one of the biggest contributors to gambling addiction and other social ills,” said Carroll in a statement. “They prey on the weakest members of our society and must be banned.”

The Assemblyman’s bill would make it a crime to own or operate a slot machine, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $15,000 fine. Slot machines are currently legal in New Jersey under certain circumstances, such as at racetracks and casinos.

Proponents of legalizing slots argue that they provide much-needed revenue for state and local governments. But Carroll counters that “the negative consequences of legalizing slot machines far outweigh any benefits.”

He is not alone in this view. Gambling addiction experts have long argued that slots are especially addictive and dangerous, and should be outlawed altogether.

Carroll’s bill has been referred to the Assembly Judiciary Committee for consideration.
