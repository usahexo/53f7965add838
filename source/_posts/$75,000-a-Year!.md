#  Higher Salary than Most Jobs in Vegas 
Do you live in or around Las Vegas? Are you looking for an interesting and lucrative job? If so, you may want to consider becoming a blackjack dealer. Blackjack dealers in Vegas can make a higher salary than most other jobs in the city. 

The average blackjack dealer in Las Vegas makes around $23 per hour. This is significantly higher than the average salary for most jobs in the city. In fact, many casino jobs only offer hourly wages of around $10-$12 per hour. 

So, why do blackjack dealers make more money than most other casino employees? The main reason is that blackjack dealers are responsible for handling large sums of money. They also have to keep track of all the game's rules and regulations. This requires a lot of knowledge and skill. 

If you are looking for a high-paying job in Las Vegas, becoming a blackjack dealer may be your best option. With a little training and practice, you could be making more money than you ever thought possible.

#  Average Dealer Earns More Than Teachers, Nurses in Vegas 

## A recent study by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas has found that the average casino dealer in the city earns more money than teachers and nurses. The report, which is set to be published in an upcoming issue of Economic Inquiry, also finds that dealers earn more than workers in a number of other service occupations, including hotel maids and cooks.

To come to these findings, the researchers analyzed data from the Census Bureau’s 2016 American Community Survey. They looked at the earnings of more than 5,000 casino dealers, 7,200 teachers, and 8,800 nurses working in Las Vegas.

On average, casino dealers in Las Vegas earn $40,100 a year. This is about $4,500 more than the average annual wage for teachers in the city and $6,600 more than the average wage for nurses. Hotel maids and cooks earn an annual salary of $25,800 and $27,600 respectively.

The study also found that casino dealers are far more likely to have a college degree than teachers or nurses. Nearly 60 percent of dealers have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to just 24 percent of teachers and 31 percent of nurses.

So why do casino dealers earn more than other service workers in Las Vegas? One possible explanation is that dealers have more skills and experience than other workers in similar occupations. They require training to deal blackjack and poker cards properly, which can take several months. Dealers must also be able to keep track of multiple games at once and make quick decisions under pressure.

Another possibility is that dealers are better-paid because they are unionized. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 represents most casino employees in Las Vegas and has successfully negotiated better wages and benefits for its members over the years. Union representation can help workers negotiate better pay and working conditions regardless of occupation.

Whatever the reason may be, the findings of this study highlight the importance of unions in ensuring that workers are fairly compensated for their skills and experience.

#  How Much Does a Blackjack Dealer Make in Las Vegas? 

In Nevada, the average blackjack dealer salary is about $25,000 a year. This, of course, varies depending on the casino and its location. 

The minimum wage in Nevada is currently $8.25 an hour, so the average blackjack dealer in Las Vegas makes around $16.50 an hour. However, many dealers can make much more than this depending on their skills and experience. 

Blackjack dealers in Las Vegas work for tips as well as a salary, so they can make significantly more depending on how good they are at their job. The best blackjack dealers can make over $100,000 per year in tips alone. 

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and there is always a high demand for dealers. If you are good at math and have some experience dealing cards, then becoming a blackjack dealer could be a great career choice for you.

#  $60,000 to $100,000: Average Salary for a Blackjack Dealer in Las Vegas

Most people think that the average salary for a blackjack dealer in Las Vegas is around $60,000. However, the median salary is actually closer to $100,000. This means that half of all blackjack dealers in Las Vegas make more than $100,000 per year, and half make less.

The reason for the discrepancy is that the top earners in the field can make quite a bit more than the average. Some high-end casinos will pay their dealers six figures to keep them on staff. And as with any other career, the more experience you have and the better you are at your job, the more money you can expect to make.

So if you’re looking for a high-paying career in Las Vegas, becoming a blackjack dealer may be a good option. The starting salary is relatively low, but with experience and skill you can easily earn a six-figure income.
