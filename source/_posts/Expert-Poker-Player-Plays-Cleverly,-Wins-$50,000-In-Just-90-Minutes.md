What made this player's victory even more impressive is that he only entered the tournament late, and had to play against some of the world's top poker pros.

In an interview after the tournament, the winning player credited his success to his clever play and ability to read his opponents' strategies. "I just tried to stay out of trouble and wait for good hands," he said.

The player, who asked not to be named, has been playing professionally for six years and says he usually plays online tournaments. This was his first time competing in a live event.
