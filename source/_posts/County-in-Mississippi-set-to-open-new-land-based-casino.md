#  County in Mississippi set to open new land-based casino

A new casino is set to open in the Mississippi county of Tunica in the near future. The casino is to be housed in a new $22 million facility, which will be operated by the Pearl River Resort.

The new facility will create around 350 jobs, and is expected to draw tourists from all over the region. It will feature around 1,000 slot machines and 40 table games.

In addition to the new casino, Tunica County is also home to nine other gambling venues, including five casinos and four dog tracks. The new casino is seen as a way to compete with these other venues and bring in more tourist dollars.

#  County in Mississippi unveils plans for new land-based casino

A county in Mississippi has unveiled plans for a new land-based casino as it looks to bolster its gaming industry. The proposed casino would be located in Natchez, and would be operated by the county’s tourism commission.

If approved, the casino would be the first of its kind in the state. It is expected to create hundreds of jobs, and would bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the county.

The proposal has been met with some opposition, however, with some residents arguing that the casino could have a negative impact on the community. Others argue that the money generated by the casino could be better used to fund other projects in the area.

Officials with the tourism commission say that they have taken these concerns into account, and that they are committed to ensuring that the casino benefits the community as a whole. They are currently working on a detailed plan for how the casino will be operated, and they hope to have it approved by the end of the year.

#  Land-based casino coming to county in Mississippi

A land-based casino is coming to a county in Mississippi, officials announced this week.

The casino will be operated by the Isle of Capri Casinos and is expected to create around 1,000 jobs. It will be located in Leflore County, which is home to the Greenwood-Leflore Industrial Complex.

According to state officials, the casino will offer a variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker. It is also expected to include a hotel, restaurant, and event space.

“We are excited about this project and the jobs it will create for our citizens,” said Joe Max Higgins Jr., CEO of the Greenwood-Leflore Industrial Complex. “The Isle of Capri Casinos are leaders in the gaming industry, and we believe their presence in Leflore County will be a major asset to our community.”

The casino is expected to open in 2020.

#  Casino development set to take place in county in Mississippi

A new casino project is set to take place in the county of Yazoo, in the state of Mississippi. The $140 million development will be carried out by Pearl River Resort, and it is expected to create around 350 jobs in the area.

The casino resort will feature a hotel, restaurants, a spa and a conference center, as well as the gaming facilities that people expect from a casino. It is hoped that the development will help to bring more tourism dollars into the state, and also boost the local economy.

This is not Pearl River Resort’s first foray into casino development – they have already opened two other casinos in the state of Mississippi. However, this new development is by far their largest project to date.

The company has been working on the plans for the new casino resort for some time now, and they are expecting it to be open for business by early 2020. This should give people plenty of time to make their travel arrangements and get ready for an exciting new gambling destination!

Mississippi has been seen as something of a hot spot for casino development in recent years. In addition to Pearl River Resort’s new development, there are several other casino projects that are currently under construction or planned in the state.

This is good news for those who enjoy gambling, as it means that there are going to be plenty of new options when it comes to places to gamble in Mississippi. It is also likely to create more jobs in the area, which can only be good news for local residents.

The casino will feature 350 slot machines and 18 table games, and is scheduled to open in late 2019.
