#  Why did he start making music?

It all started when he was just a little kid. He loved music and he loved making things. So he started making music.

Making music is a great way to express yourself. It's a way to share your feelings with the world. And that's why he started making music. He wanted to share his feelings with the world.

In a previous interview, Ed Sheeran said his favorite thing to do outside of music is play video games. "I love video games," he said. "I'm really into my video games. I'm quite a geeky guy."

Sheeran isn't the only celebrity who loves gaming. In fact, there are quite a few celebrities who love gaming so much they've even created their own video games. For example, rapper and actor Curtis Jackson, better known as 50 Cent, has his own mobile game called G-Unit Radio which allows users to battle other players online.

And then there's Justin Bieber, who teamed up with Rovio Entertainment, the creators of Angry Birds, to release an AR mini-game for the worldwide smash hit game Angry Birds 2. In the game, players help Justin Bieber collect coins and dodge obstacles as they try to make their way to the concert stage.

So why do celebrities love gaming so much? One reason could be that it's a great way for them to escape from reality and just have some fun. Gaming can also help celebrities blow off some steam after a long day of work. And let's not forget that many celebrities are actually pretty good at gaming too. So it's no surprise that they enjoy playing them every now and then.

#  What is his goal with music?

What is his goal with music? Is it to make money, or is it to reach people and touch them in some way? Many people in the industry view music as a business, and they are in it for the money. However, there are also artists out there who see music as a way to connect with people on a deeper level. They want to share their message and touch peopleâ€™s hearts with their music.

For most artists, money is not the main goal. They just want to be able to share their music with the world. This is what drives them to continue making music, even when things get tough. There is a passion there that cannot be denied.

Of course, many artists do want to make money from their music, and that is perfectly understandable. However, at the end of the day, if they can reach people and touch them with their music, then they have succeeded in what they set out to do.
