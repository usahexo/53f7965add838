#  Playing Cards for All: How Much Is a Slot Machine for Shakespeare?

In the early 1590s, an unknown author penned a series of 52 sonnets. To this day, they remain some of the most widely read and beloved poetry in the English language. The author's name? William Shakespeare.

While we may think of Shakespeare as a playwright, many of his works were originally written in sonnet form. And like any good poet, Shakespeare was fascinated with the concept of change. In particular, he was intrigued by how life can be full of endless flux - a theme that is explored in many of his plays, including Macbeth and King Lear.

This week, we're going to take a look at one of Shakespeare's most famous sonnets, number 18: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?". In this sonnet, Shakespeare compares the beauty of his love to the beauty of a summer day. He talks about how both are full of potential for growth and change, and how both are fleeting and temporary.

What is interesting about this sonnet is that it wasn't actually published until 1609 - several years after it was written. This suggests that Shakespeare may have been performing it privately for friends and family members before finally putting it into print.

As we mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death this year, let's take a look at some of his most famous sonnets. Sonnet 18 is just one example - but each one is worth reading in its own right.

4) Make sure you keep track of how many spins you’ve made – this will help prevent you from spending too much money in a short period of time.
