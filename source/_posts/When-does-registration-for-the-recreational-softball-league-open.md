The season for many sports around the world typically ends in late May or early June. In the United States, the National Football League (NFL) has its final game every year on the first Sunday of February. The Super Bowl is the biggest annual sports event in the United States, and it usually garners high viewership both domestically and internationally.

In Europe, many football leagues have their seasons end in May. The English Premier League, Spain’s La Liga, and Italy’s Serie A are among the most popular leagues in the world, and their championship games usually take place in late May or early June.

College sports also have seasons that generally conclude by early June. The NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament is one of the country’s most popular sporting events, and it culminates with the Final Four a few weeks before Easter. Other marquee college sports events such as the NCAA Division I Football Championship Game and the College World Series also take place in either late May or early June.
