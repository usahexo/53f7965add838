#  Wynn Casino in Vegas Sold to Russian Billionaire 

On February 21, 2018, it was announced that the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas had been sold to Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko for $2.9 billion. This is the highest price ever paid for a casino in the United States. 

The Wynn Casino is a popular destination for tourists and visitors in Las Vegas. It features two towers with a total of 2,716 hotel rooms and suites. The casino has more than 142,000 square feet of gambling space, including a sportsbook, poker room, and high-limit area. It is also home to several restaurants, nightclubs, and a spa. 

The sale of the Wynn Casino comes as no surprise given the recent sexual misconduct allegations made against its founder and former CEO, Steve Wynn. In January 2018, Wynn resigned from his position after multiple women came forward saying that he had sexually harassed or assaulted them over the years. 

Wynn Resorts is still facing several lawsuits related to the allegations against Steve Wynn. The company has pledged to donate $2.5 million to help support the MeToo movement.

#  Wynn Casino in Vegas Sold to Chinese Billionaire 

The Wynn Casino in Vegas was just sold to a Chinese billionaire for $4 billion. This is one of the most expensive casino transactions in history.

The new owner is currently unknown, but it is speculated that he is from Beijing and has a net worth of over $10 billion. He is said to be very interested in gambling and has a number of casinos in China.

This sale could have a big impact on the Vegas gambling scene. The Wynn casino was one of the most successful casinos in Vegas, and its new owner is sure to make some changes. It will be interesting to see how the other casinos in Vegas compete with a casino that is now owned by a Chinese billionaire.

#  Wynn Casino in Vegas Sold to Japanese Billionaire 

The Wynn Casino in Las Vegas has been sold to billionaire Kazuo Okada for $2.7 billion, the largest purchase of a casino in United States history. 

Okada is the founder of Universal Entertainment Corporation, a Japanese gaming and electronics company. He is the third richest person in Japan with a net worth of $4.8 billion. 

The Wynn Casino is one of the most profitable casinos in the world and was founded by Steve Wynn. It features 2,500 hotel rooms, a spa, several restaurants, and of course, a casino. 

This sale is sure to shake up the casino industry in Las Vegas and could lead to more acquisitions in the future.

#  Wynn Casino in Vegas Sold to Indian Billionaire 

Less than a week after Steve Wynn resigned as CEO of Wynn Resorts amidst sexual misconduct allegations, the company has agreed to sell its flagship casino in Las Vegas to Indian billionaire and founder of Bharti Enterprises, Sunil Mittal. 

The $2.4 billion deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and will give Bharti ownership of the coveted hotel and casino on the Strip. This is not Mittal's first foray into the Vegas gaming market; he also owns a stake in Caesars Entertainment Corporation. 

In a statement, Mittal said that he was "delighted" to be buying Wynn Las Vegas. "It is one of the world's iconic hotels, and we look forward to owning it and operating it for many years to come." 

Details of the agreement have not been released, but it is thought that Wynn Resorts will continue to operate Wynn Las Vegas under a long-term management contract. 

The sale comes as no surprise; given Wynn's resignation and the allegations against him, the company has been under pressure from shareholders to sell its properties. It is also possible that the sale could help Wynn Resorts avoid being delisted from Nasdaq. 

Wynn Resorts' stock was up 5 percent following the announcement of the deal.

#  Wynn Casino in Vegas Sold to Saudi Arabian Billionaire

It was announced on Tuesday that the Wynn casino in Las Vegas has been sold to the Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal for $2.4 billion. The deal is still pending regulatory approval, but when it goes through, it will be the largest single property purchase in Las Vegas history.

The Wynn is a prime piece of real estate on the Las Vegas Strip, and it's no surprise that someone with as much money as Prince Alwaleed would want to buy it. The casino is known for its luxurious amenities, including a private beach, high-end shops and restaurants, and of course, gambling tables and slot machines.

Prince Alwaleed already owns several other large properties around the world, including the George V hotel in Paris and the Plaza hotel in New York City. He's also said to be a big fan of Las Vegas, so it seems like this purchase was a natural fit for him.

In a statement about the sale, Steve Wynn said "It has been my great honour and privilege to build the Wynn Resort and Casino . . . I am confident that Prince Alwaleed will bring continued success to our company."

The Wynn casino has been one of the most successful casinos in Las Vegas since it opened in 2005, so it will be interesting to see how things change under new ownership.
