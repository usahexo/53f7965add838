#  Indiana follows Michigan in announcing gambling cutbacks

Michigan and Indiana have announced that they will be limiting the hours that their casinos can operate, in response to concerns over the impact of gambling on state budgets.

Indiana Governor Mike Pence said in a statement that the new rules would take effect on July 1st, and that they were necessary in order to protect the state's taxpayers. The new restrictions will mean that casinos in the state will be able to open at 10am instead of 8am, and will have to close at midnight rather than 2am.

The move comes after Michigan's Governor Rick Snyder sign a bill last week which reduces the hours casinos can operate from 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to 18 hours a day on Monday through Thursday, and from 8am to 2am on weekends.

Both states are facing major budget shortfalls, with Indiana facing a deficit of $1.5 billion this year, and Michigan facing a shortfall of $1.8 billion. Gambling is seen as one potential way of filling these gaps, but there are concerns that too much gambling can lead to addiction and crime.

Supporters of the cuts argue that they are necessary to protect vulnerable people from becoming addicted to gambling, while opponents argue that they will harm the casino industry and cost jobs.

#  Ohio shuts down 5 gambling sites following state budget crisis

In a move that has puzzled many in the online gambling world, the state of Ohio shut down five of its six gambling sites on October 15. This came just days after the state legislature failed to pass a budget, leading to a government shutdown.

While no official statement has been released by the state as to why these sites were targeted, some believe that it may be connected to the budget crisis. It is speculated that the state is using the closure of these sites as a way to raise revenue and help plug the budget shortfall.

Others believe that this could be just the beginning, and that more gambling sites may be shut down in the coming weeks and months. With no clear indication as to why these sites were chosen, players and operators are left in limbo, not knowing what to expect next.

For now, those affected by the closure are waiting for news from the state government. While there is no telling what will happen next, one thing is for sure â€“ this closure has left a lot of people wondering what went wrong.

#  West Virginia announces restrictions on casino and racetrack betting

West Virginia Governor Jim Justice has announced restrictions on casino and racetrack betting that are set to take effect on July 1. The move is an attempt to address a budget shortfall in the state.

According to the new rules, only one bet may be placed per person on any given race or sporting event. In addition, the maximum bet that can be placed at a casino will be reduced from $10,000 to $5,000.

Governor Justice said that the measures are necessary in order to close a $500 million budget gap. He also noted that they will help to protect the state's casino industry from out-of-state competition.

The restrictions have been met with criticism from some lawmakers and gambling advocates who argue that they will hurt the state's economy. However, others claim that the changes are long overdue and are necessary for protecting West Virginia's interests.

#  Delaware casinos see decrease in revenue after new restrictions enforced

It's been a little over a year since new restrictions on Delaware casinos were enforced, and it looks like the effects are being felt. Revenue from table games and slots has seen a decrease since the policy went into effect.

The new restrictions, which include a ban on cash payouts for jackpots of less than $600 and limits on how much people can wager per day, were put in place in an effort to crack down on illegal gambling. But it seems that the policy may be having the opposite effect.

George Myers, who owns four of the state's casinos, said that revenue has fallen by as much as 10 percent since the policy was put into place. "We can't continue to operate at a disadvantage," Myers said.

It's not just the casinos that are feeling the effects of the new restrictions; employees are too. Casino workers have seen their hours reduced as a result of the declining revenue, and some have even been laid off.

Governor John Carney defended the policy, saying that it is necessary to protect Delaware's gaming industry from out-of-state competition. "The goal here is to make sure that Delaware's gaming industry remains strong, and part of that is making sure that we're doing everything we can to prevent illegal gambling from happening in our state," Carney said.

Despite the governor's defense, it seems that the new restrictions are not having the desired effect. Revenue continues to decline, and casino employees are losing their jobs. It will be interesting to see if these trends continue in years to come.
